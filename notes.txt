Hello, these are some notes on the global advancement of the project plus some ideas and thoughts on where to head and how to achieve it.

Mid-term goals : Build a bittorrent downloader
Long-term goals : Intergrate the bittorrent downloader to a platrform that allows a basic client-server download with torrent files.
This platform will act as a middleman between the client and the torrent files he wishes to download. the platform will downlaod and cache the torrent file with the Bittorent Protocol and forward it to the requester.
I am actually considering to forwarding methods:
    - Download the file in it entirety and then forward it. (The easy way)
    - Dynamic download (idk about the name) : something similar to how Mega works.

I started with a thorough documentation on the Bittorrent protocol.
# Relevant resources:
    - Bittorrent Protocol Specification : https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification
    - Some videos and blogs that I bookmarked.


# Project Overview
The bittorrent process can be summarized as follows:

## Extracting the torrent files metadata

    2- Parsing and requesting a magnet link.


For now, i have only managed to do the first case.
The .torrent file contains metadata about the torrent resource that is simply a bencoded dictionary.
The most important data provided is :
    - announce : the principal tracker url.
    - announce-list : other trackers on where
