Hello, these are some notes on the global advancement of the project plus some ideas and thoughts on where to head and how to achieve it.

Mid-term goals : Build a bittorrent downloader
Long-term goals : Intergrate the bittorrent downloader to a platrform that allows a basic client-server download with torrent files.
This platform will act as a middleman between the client and the torrent files he wishes to download. the platform will downlaod and cache the torrent file with the Bittorent Protocol and forward it to the requester.
I am actually considering to forwarding methods:
    - Download the file in it entirety and then forward it. (The easy way)
    - Dynamic download (idk about the name) : something similar to how Mega works.

I started with a thorough documentation on the Bittorrent protocol.
# Relevant resources:
    - Bittorrent Protocol Specification : https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification
    - Some videos and blogs that I bookmarked.


# Project Overview
The bittorrent process can be summarized as follows:

## Extracting the torrent files metadata
Torrent resources can be retrieved in 2 different ways :
    1- Parsing a .torrent file
    2- Parsing and requesting a magnet link


For now, i have only managed to do the first case.
The .torrent file contains metadata about the torrent resource that is simply a bencoded dictionary.
The most important data provided is :
    - announce : the principal tracker url.
    - announce-list : other trackers on where
    - ...

Next step of the process is sending a request to the trackers, so that we can receive the address (IP + Port number) of the peers who have this torrent.
The request structure is as follows: 
	* URL of the tracker
	* ...

## Magnet Links
    xt (extract topic) : a URN formed from the content hash of a particular file. hex-encoded SHA-1 hash of the torrent file info section.
        eg : magnet:?xt=urn:btih:c12fe1c06bba254a9dc9f519b335aa7c1367a88a
        Bittorrent special : xt=urn:btih:[ BitTorrent Info Hash (Hex) ]

    dn (Display Name): a filename to display to the user, for convenience
    tr (address TRacker): tracker URL for BitTorrent downloads
        Used to obtain resources for BitTorrent downloads without a need for DHT support. The value must be URL encoded.
        tr=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fannounce

    xl (eXact Length): size in bytes
    xt (eXact Topic): URN containing file hash
    ws (Web Seed): the payload data served over HTTP(S)
    as (Acceptable Source): Web link to the file online
    xs (eXact Source): P2P link identified by a content-hash
    kt (Keyword Topic): a more general search, specifying keywords, rather than a particular file
    mt (Manifest Topic): link to the metafile that contains a list of magneto (MAGMA â€“ MAGnet MAnifest)
