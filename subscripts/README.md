After trying to implement a solution to download a torrent file, I found myself not having the required knowledge. I realised that I don't know much about event-driven programming and still hesitant about using multithreading or an asyncronous approach.

Now, what I'll try to do is to divide the entire downloading process into small scripts and store their results for the next script usage. This way I'll be able to test smaller functions and recombine them when I'll be more confident.

I really underestimated the complexity and the required knowledge of this *mini* project.
